This is a Python + Django app to log a person's mood from day-to-day

## Technical Requirements
* Use Python/Django

## Pictures / Stage Progress  


## Plan of Action
* Which graphing chart to use, as I tried several but Plotly seemed to work the best.

## Libraries used  

* Django
* Plotly


## What Was Difficult
* Converting Python date format to milliseconds
* Django templating didn't iterate through a list in a dictionary, which led to a few work-arounds

## What I Liked
* Learning Plotly
* Django database interfacing is SWEET

## Oustanding Issues
* Still needs a way to edit an entry
* The plot could look better, as some dots are cut off by the margin

## Future Ideas
* Different ways to create visual charts to graph emotions
